# Neural Network Sandbox

An assignment collection for course _CE5037_ in National Central University, Taiwan.

## TODO

* Read parameters from QML
* Perceptron algorithm must have some bugs, the correct rate is a bit weird. Draw the equation line to debug.
  * Get synaptic weights of all neurons when `current_times` in bridge updated.
* Try [cached_property](https://werkzeug.palletsprojects.com/en/0.15.x/utils/#werkzeug.utils.cached_property) to save self-containing class property.
* MLP Algorithm
